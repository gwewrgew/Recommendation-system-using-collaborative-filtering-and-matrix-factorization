# Example using the Surprise library and matrix factorization algorithm
from surprise import Dataset
from surprise import SVD
from surprise import accuracy
from surprise.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load the movielens-100k dataset
data = Dataset.load_builtin('ml-100k')

# Split the data into training and testing sets
trainset, testset = train_test_split(data, test_size=0.2)

# Create a matrix factorization-based recommendation algorithm
algo = SVD()

# Train the algorithm on the training set
algo.fit(trainset)

# Predict ratings for the test set

# Calculate RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

# Print the RMSE
